Personal Portfolio of Rahul Chandak.

An attempt to design my own fully responsive website from scratch as a means to learn web development technologies like React, Node, Bootstrap, etc instead of using ready-made templates from the internet. It is a work-in-progress project and you can expect to see improvements in the near future. 

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn for suggestions, to know how I designed the site, etc. 

It is hosted on Netlify. Link: https://rahulschandak.netlify.app/

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
